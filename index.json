The method uses a coset operating mode and nonzero-syndrome-based decoding to accelerate the simulation of the read-channel's error-rate characteristics corresponding to different parity-check matrices employed in the read-channel's turbo-decoder, such as a low-density parity-check decoder. The acceleration is achieved through recycling some previously generated log-likelihood-ratio values, which enables the method to sometimes bypass certain time-consuming processing steps therein.","tags":["Read Channel","LDPC","Turbo Code","Syndrome","Storage System"],"title":"Accelerator for a read-channel design and simulation tool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleksey Letunovskiy","Alexander Markovic","Ivan Mazurenko","Denis Parfenov","Aleksandr Petiushko Александр Петюшко"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1398729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1398729600,"objectID":"128fa0a1fe0eea97f2a2b2d91df2f5e8","permalink":"https://petiushko.info/publication/patent_2014_motion/","publishdate":"2014-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/patent_2014_motion/","section":"publication","summary":"A video transcoder for converting an encoded input video bit-stream having one spatial resolution into an encoded output video bit-stream having a lower spatial resolution, wherein motion-vector dispersion observed at the higher spatial resolution is quantified and used to configure the motion-vector search at the lower spatial resolution.
